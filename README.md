# A PyQt cross-OS desktop app

I copied the [Common PyQt Widgets](https://github.com/pyqt/examples/blob/_/src/02%20PyQt%20Widgets) example program, but restructured the code to my taste.

## Usage

    $ python app.py

## Dependencies

Things you'll need to do first:

1. Get Python if you don't have it. At the time, I was using 3.12.

2.

    $ python -m venv venv

This creates a "virtual environment". I guess it's like site_modules from npm. It will locally contain any packages you install. [More.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

3.

    $ source venv/bin/activate

Execute shell commands for the virtual environment. It adds stuff to your PATH and whatnot.

4.

    $ pip install PyQt6

All done, ready to use.
